![Web Screenshot](assets/images/mockup.png)

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript makes up the holy trinity of front-end technologies. Front ends of all websites, whether small or large, are built using these three languages and are a vital skill to have if you’re interested in becoming a front-end developer.
 
This JavaScript Multiple Choice Questions Quiz (MCQs), was developed to give the user a quick and informal assessment of the user's knowledge of Javascript. The targeted audience is anyone interested in testing and growing their JavaScript knowledge in an entertaining and challenging way. At the end of the quiz, the users final score will be displayed.
